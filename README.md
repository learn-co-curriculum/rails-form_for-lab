# `form_for` Lab

## Objectives

1. Use `form_for` to build a `new` form
2. Use `form_for` to build an `edit` form
3. Mass assign form data to `ActiveRecord` instances on `new` and `edit`
4. Build RESTFul actions for `new`, `create`, `edit`, and `update`, with the correct routes and route helper urls.


## Instructions

For this lab you will be extending the functionality of the Flatiron school's student management application by building in the functionality to create and edit school classes. You will build all of the functionality from scratch, including building out the models, views, and controllers for the `SchoolClass` and `Student` resources.

Below is what will be needed for each component of the MVC structure:

* **Models** - Create a `SchoolClass` model, along with its associated database table. The `SchoolClass` table should have the columns: `title:string` and `room_number:integer`. The `Student` model and database table have already been created for you.

* **Controllers** - Create controller files for `school_classes` and `students`. Build out the `new`, `create`, `show`, `edit`, and `update` actions in each of the controllers.

* **Views** - Create a show page for each resource, along with `new` and `edit` forms.

You will also need to create routes for each path mentioned above.

The tests for this application are located in the `spec/controllers/`, `spec/features/`, and `spec/models/` directories.


## Requirements

Utilize the `form_for` methods for all four of the forms (new and edit in `school_classes` and `students`) and integrate each `form_for` call with the respective controller actions. Also make sure to utilize the `<%= f.submit %>` submit button syntax to have the button text automatically generated.

Since you're using `form_for`, make sure you are using strong parameters for the controller `create` and `update` actions, if you don't remember how to do it, here is how we implemented strong params in the README: `@post.update(params.require(:post).permit(:title, :description))`. (hint: you can pass the strong parameter call to the `new` method just like we did on `update`)

If you run into issues drawing the routes, inspect element on the forms to see what path `form_for` is automatically trying to pass the form data to.
